# PNGme

⚠ SPOILERS AHEAD ⚠

This is my take on [PNGme: An Intermediate Rust Project](https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/).
It was great fun and I would recommend it to anybody as a fun learning experience.

I have diverted a bit from the original instructions and plan to use it a playground to expand my Rust skills. One thing I added is error handling, which so far is primarily done manually without any third-party crates (I plan to switch to _anyhow_ and/or _thiserror_).

## Roadmap 

... with inspiration from the [next steps](https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/chapter_6.html).

- [x] Basic CLI functionalities
- [x] Error handling
- [ ] Code Documentation
- [ ] Split into library and binary cratoe
- [ ] Further improve error handling with _anyhow_ and _thiserror_
